IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY
-----------------------------------
1. ANALYSIS: Comprehensive analysis of original dataset imbalances
2. DOWNSAMPLING: Reduced tech roles from 86% to 35% through random sampling
3. SYNTHETIC GENERATION: Created 492 realistic synthetic records
4. SKILL ASSIGNMENT: Added missing skills with job-appropriate logic
5. DEGREE BALANCING: Added Bachelor's degrees to reach 40% target
6. CERTIFICATION BALANCING: Ensured all certifications ≥4% coverage
7. VALIDATION: Comprehensive validation against all success criteria
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE: Fixed missing values and ensured data integrity

LOGICAL CONSTRAINTS MAINTAINED
----------------------------------------
✅ Tech roles have higher tech skills (Python, SQL, ML)
✅ Finance roles have appropriate certifications (CFA, CPA)
✅ Experience correlates with salary and degree level
✅ Skills count matches actual skills present
✅ No contradictory skill/cert combinations
✅ Realistic salary ranges by job type and experience
✅ Text lengths vary realistically
