Leakage Audit
--------------
Grouping column: Resume_ID (used only to enforce group-aware split)
Dropped features to reduce leakage:
- AI Score (0-100)
- AI Score (0-100)_reflect_log
- Resume_ID

Rationale:
- 'AI Score (0-100)' and its log variant are highly correlated with the target and can introduce target leakage.
- 'Resume_ID' is an identifier, not predictive content; excluding it avoids group mixing in features.

Features used after dropping: 52
