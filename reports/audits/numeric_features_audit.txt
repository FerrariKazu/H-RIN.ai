Numeric Features Audit Report
-----------------------------

This report confirms the status of numeric features after data cleaning and normalization.

Input Dataset: data/normalized_dataset_v3.csv
Rows: 477

Audit Result:
No new near-constant flags were identified in the numeric features of `data/normalized_dataset_v3.csv`. All previously identified constant features (e.g., `feat_num_numbers`, `feat_num_bullets`) were addressed in earlier processing steps or are no longer present in the dataset after duplicate removal and column dropping.

Further monitoring will be conducted as the dataset evolves.
